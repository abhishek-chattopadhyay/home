I completed my B.Sc. in Chemistry at the University of Calcutta in 2017, after which I pursued my M.Sc. in Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, graduating in 2019. Immediately afterward, I joined Ruhr University Bochum in Germany as a research assistant in the group of Prof. Dominik Marx, where I worked from 2019 to 2020 on the computational chemistry of nanoconfined ionic solutions. 

From 2021 to 2025, I worked as a scientific researcher at the Technical University of Darmstadt in the group of Prof. Nico van der Vegt. During this period, I developed a novel in-silico methodology to predict the solubility of materials by combining molecular dynamics simulations with data-driven modeling approaches. 

In 2026, I joined Maastricht University as a model steward for the VHP4Safety project, where I look forward to contributing to the development, validation, and responsible use of computational models in chemical safety assessment. 

Beyond research, I enjoy exploring nature through hiking and traveling, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and playing guitar in my free time. I am also passionate about data science and AI and love sharing AI insights with broader audiences.
