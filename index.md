    <h3>Hi, I'm Abhishek.</h3>
    <p class="lede">
      I work at the intersection of toxicology and systems biology, data science, AI, FAIR data principles and helping computational models become trustworthy tools for chemical safety and scientific discovery.

      I completed my B.Sc. in Chemistry at the University of Calcutta in 2017, after which I pursued my M.Sc. in Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, graduating in 2019. Immediately afterward, I joined Ruhr University Bochum in Germany as a research assistant in the group of Prof. Dominik Marx, where I worked from 2019 to 2020 on the computational chemistry of nanoconfined ionic solutions.

    <p>
      From 2021 to 2025, I worked as a scientific researcher at the Technical University of Darmstadt in the group of Prof. Nico van der Vegt. During this period, I developed a novel in-silico methodology to predict the solubility of materials by combining molecular dynamics simulations with data-driven modeling approaches.

    <p>
      In 2026, I joined Maastricht University as a model steward for the VHP4Safety project, where I look forward to contributing to the development, validation, and responsible use of computational models in chemical safety assessment.

    <p>
      Beyond research, I enjoy exploring nature through hiking and traveling, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and playing guitar in my free time. I am also passionate about data science and AI and love sharing AI insights with broader audiences.

## About

I completed my B.Sc. in Chemistry at the University of Calcutta (2017), then my M.Sc. at IIT Kanpur (2019).  
From 2019–2020, I worked at Ruhr University Bochum (Prof. Dominik Marx) on the computational chemistry of nanoconfined ionic solutions.

From 2021–2025, I was a scientific researcher at Technical University Darmstadt in Germany (Prof. Nico van der Vegt), where I developed an in-silico methodology to predict material solubility by combining molecular dynamics simulations and Kirkwood-Buff theory.

In 2026, I joined Maastricht University as a Model Steward for the VHP4Safety project, contributing to the development, validation, and responsible use of computational models in chemical safety assessment.

Beyond research, I enjoy hiking and traveling, cooking, and playing guitar. I also like sharing AI insights with broader audiences.
